Currently ~~undergoing sporadic redesign~~ is a dumpster fire.

# Specifications

* Every cell of the maze should be traversable.
* Every cell should know which of its four walls are active.
* One cell on the top and bottom of the maze should serve as exit and entry points.
* Graphical representation of maze should be separate, and handled with pygame 2.0.0.
